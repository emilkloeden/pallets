# Computers and Representation of Colors

Computers display colors that are represented as a triad of values known as RGB (Red, Green Blue). These are a group of three different values in the range 0-255. In reality these three values are multipled against each other, but it's conceptually simpler to think of them as three separate values. In CSS these are usually converted to hex codes so black in RGB is (0, 0, 0) and in hex is "000000" whilst white is RGB (255, 255, 255) or "FFFFFF". These are commonly prefixed with an octothorpe symbol e.g. '#FFFFFF'

It's worth remembering that Red, Green and Blue is not the same as the three primary colors Red, Yellow and Blue. This results in some translation difficulty when it comes to switching between schemes.

Some RGB and Hex Code values:
|Color|Color Type|RGB|Hex
|--|--|--|--|
|Red|Primary|255, 0, 0|#FF0000
|Lime|Secondary?|0, 255, 0|#00FF00
|Blue|Primary|0, 0, 255|#0000FF
|Yellow|Primary|255, 255, 0|#FFFF00
|Cyan|Secondary?|0, 255, 255|#00FFFF
|Magenta|Secondary?|255, 0, 255|#FF00FF
|Silver| |192, 192, 192|#C0C0C0
|Gray| |128, 128, 128|#808080
|Maroon| |128, 0, 0|#800000
|Olive| |128, 128, 0|#808000
|Green| |0, 128, 0|#008000
|Purple| |128, 0, 128|#800080
|Teal| |0, 128, 128|#008080
|Navy| |0, 0, 128|#000080

Another means of representing colors is Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (HSL), where Red is represented as (0, 100%, 100%).

# Colors

## Hue

    Hue refers to the pure pigment of a color, without tint or shade. In that respect, hue can be interpreted as the origin of a color. Any one of the six primary and secondary colors is a hue.

## Shade

    Shade refers to how much black is added into the hue. As such, shade darkens a color.

To add shade you should multiple each component by a fraction of its value (e.g. 1/4, 1/2 etc.)
Thus if we start with yellow (255, 255, 0) (#FFFF00) and we multiply the R, G, and B, values by 0.25 we get (63, 63, 0) (after rounding) which is a darker shade of yellow than if we were to multiply the values by 0.8 (203, 203, 0).

Another means of representing colors is Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (HSL), where Red is represented as (0, 100%, 100%). Adding shade here is done by reducing the L value alone.

Here's a quick and dirty script to paste into a browser console that demonstrates this

```js
function hslMe(n = 6, hue = 0) {
  document.body.innerHTML = `<div><ul id="ul">${"<li>COLORS, OH MY!</li>".repeat(
    n
  )}</ul></div>`;
  const li = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("li"));
  li.forEach((el, i) => {
    el.setAttribute(
      "style",
      `font-size:6rem; color: hsl(${hue}, 100%, ${
        100 * (1 - (1 / (li.length - 1)) * i)
      }%`
    );
  });
}
// 6 equidistant values (5 steps) of White -> Red -> Black
hslMe();

// 4 equidistant values (3 steps) of White -> Yellow -> Black
hslMe(4, 60);
```

## Tint

    The opposite of shade, tint refers to how much white is added to a color. As such, tint lightens a color.

## Tone

    Tone is the result of a color that has had both white and black added to it. In other words, tone refers to any hue that has been modified with the addition of greyâ€”as long as the grey is purely neutral (only containing white and black).

# Schemes

## Monochromatic

    Monochromatic color schemes are formed using various tones and shades of one single color.

Key words there being: `tone`, `shade` and `color` (or hue, really).

Thus if HSL is available we can generate a collection of values with a different saturation level to achieve this theme.
